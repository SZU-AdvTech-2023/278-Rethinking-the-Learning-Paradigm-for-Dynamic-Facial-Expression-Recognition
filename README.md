We propose a weakly supervised approach to model Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) as a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) problem. 

The Multi-3D Dynamic Facial Expression Learning (M3DFEL) framework provides a unified solution to the weakly supervised problem and model the imbalanced short- and long-term temporal relationships in DFER.

On the basis of the original cross entropy loss, an emotional intensity perception loss has been added, allowing the network to pay extra attention to the most easily confused categories in each sample.
